## About Me

I’m a second year MPhil student supervised by Prof. <a href="https://vlislab22.github.io/vlislab/linwang.html">Lin Wang</a> at VLISLab, HKUST (GZ), interested in low-level vision, multi-modal generation, brain signals and other computer vision topics. Prior to HKUST, I obtained my BEng from Tongji University, supervised by Prof.  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aYKQn88AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Wei Tian</a>, where I start my academic journey about autonomous driving.
